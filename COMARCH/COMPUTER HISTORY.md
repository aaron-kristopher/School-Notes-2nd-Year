### EDVAC
---
- **EDVAC** stands for **Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer**.
- **The First Stored Program Computer**.
- Designed by Von Neumann in 1952.
- It has a memory to hold both a stored program as well as data.

### The First Portable Computer

- Released in 1981 by the Osborne Computer Corporation.

### The First Computer Company
---
- The first computer company was the **Electronic Controls Company**.
- Founded in 1949 by **J. Presper Eckert ** and **John Mauchly**

# Computer Generations
---

- **First Generation** - 1946 - 1958
- **Second Generation** - 1959 - 1964
- **Third Generation** - 1965 - 1970
- **Fourth Generation** - 1971 - Today
- **Fifth Generation** - Today to the Future

## The First Generation
---
- The first computers used **vacuum tubes** for circuitry and **magnetic drums** for memory, and were often enormous, taking up entire rooms.
- They were very expensive to operate and in addition to using a great deal of electricity, generated a lot of heat, which was often the cause of malfunctions.
- First generation computers relied on machine language, the lowest-level programming language understood by computers, to perform operations, and they could only solve one problem at a time.
- Input was based on punched cards and paper tape, and output was displayed on printouts.

## The Second Generation
---
- Transistors replaced vacuum tubes and ushered in the second generation of computers.
- One transistor replaced the equivalent of **40 vacuum tubes**. Allowing computers to become smaller, faster, cheaper, more energy efficient and more reliable.
- Still generated a great deal of heat that can damage the computer. 
- Second-generation computers moved from cryptic binary machine language to symbolic, or assembly languages, which allowed programmers to specify instructions in words.
- Second-generation computers still relied on punched cards for input and printouts for output.
- these were also the first computers that stored their instructions in their memory, which moved from a magnetic drum to magnetic core technology.

## The Third Generation
---
- The development of the **integrated circuit** was the hallmark of the third generation of computers.
- Transistors were miniaturized and placed on silicon chips, called semiconductors, which drastically increased the speed and efficiency of computers.
- Much smaller and cheaper compared to the second generation computers.
- It could carry out instructions in billionths of a second.
- Users interacted with third generation computers through keyboards and monitors and interfaced with an operating system, which allowed the device to run many different applications at one time with a central program that monitored the memory.
- Computers for the first time became accessible to a mass audience because they were small and cheaper than their predecessors.

## The Fourth Generation
---
- The **microprocessor** brought the fourth generation of computers, as thousands of integrated circuits were built onto a single silicon chip.
- As these small computers became more powerful, they could be linked together to form networks, which eventually led to the development of the Internet.
- Fourth generation computers also saw the development of GUIs, the mouse and the handheld devices.

## The Fifth Generation
---
- Based on Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Still in development
- The use of parallel processing and superconductors is helping to make artificial intelligence a reality.
- The goal is to develop devices that respond to natural language input and are capable of learning and self-organization.
- There are some applications, such as voice recognition, that are being used today.
