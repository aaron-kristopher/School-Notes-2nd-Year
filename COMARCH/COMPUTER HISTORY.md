# Definition of Computer
---
- Computer is a programmable machine
- Computer is a machine that manipulate data according to a list of instructions
- Computer is any device which aids humans in performing various kinds of computations or calculations

**Three principle characteristic of computer:**

- It responds to a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner.
- It can execute a pre-recorded list of instructions.
- It can quickly store and retrieve large amounts of data.

# Earliest Computer
---
- Originally calculations were computed by humans, whose job title was computer.
- These human computers were typically engaged in the calculation of mathematical expressions.
- The calculations of this period were specialized and expensive, requiring years of training in mathematics.
- The first use of the word "computer" was recorded in 1613, referring to a person who carried out calculations, or computations, and the word continued to be used in the sense until the middle of the 20th century.

### Tally Sticks
---
A **tally stick** was an ancient memory aid device to record and document numbers, quantities, or even messages.

### Abacus
---
- An **abacus** is a mechanical device used to aid an individual in performing mathematical calculations.
- The **abacus** was invented in Babylonia in 2400 B.C.
- The abacus in the form we are most familiar with was first used in China in around 500 B.C.
- It used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### Napier's Bone
---
- Invented by **John Napier** in 1614.
- Allowed the operator to **multiply, divide** and **calculate square** and **cube roots** by moving the rods around and placing them in specially constructed boards.

### Slide Ruler
---
- Invented by **William Oughtred** in **1622**
- Is based on Napier's ideas about **logarithms**
- Used primarily for:
	- **multiplication**
	- **division**
	- **roots**
	- **logarithms**
	- **Trigonometry**
- Not normally used for addition and subtraction.

### Pascaline
---
- Was invented by **Blaise Pascal** in 1642.
- It was limited to addition and subtraction.
- It was too expensive.

### Stepped Rocker
---
- Invented by **Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz** in 1672.
- The machine that can add, subtract, multiply and divide automatically.

### Arithmometer
---
- A mechanical calculator invented by **Thomas de Colmar** in 1820.
- The first reliable, useful and commercially successful calculating machine.
- The machine could perform the four basic arithmetic functions
- The first mass-produced calculating machine.

### Difference Engine and Analytical Engine
---
- It is an automatic, mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions.
- Invented by **Charles Babbage** in **1822 and 1834**
- It is the first mechanical computer.

### First Computer Programmer
---
- In 1840, **Augusta Ada Byron** suggests to Babbage that he use the binary system.
- She writes programs for the **Analytical Engine**

### Scheutzian Calculation Engine
---
- Invented by **Per Goerg Scheutz** in 1843.
- Based on Charles Babbage's difference engine.
- The first **printing calculator**.

### Tabulating Machine
