##### Sample Scenario
---
A cup contains two dice identical in appearance. One, however, is fair(unbiased) and the other is loaded (biased).

1. The probability of rolling a 3 on the fair[^1] die is 1/6 (0.166).
2. The probability of tossing the same number on the loaded[^2] die is 0.60.
3. We select one by chance, toss it and get 3.
4. What is the probability that the die rolled was fair?
5. What is the probability that the loaded die was rolled?

[^1]: - Fair = equal prior probabilities
[^2]: - Loaded = unequal prior probabilities
