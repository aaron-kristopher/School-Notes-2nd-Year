# Operations Research

- It is an Art and Science
- Primary **applications areas** of Operations Research include **forecasting, production scheduling, inventory control, capital budgeting, and transportation.

- **Operations Research** -  is an approach of using mathematical and analytical methods.
- **Forecasting** - guessing the future outcome.
- **Production Scheduling** - a timeline of producing/selling products.
- **Inventory Control** - managing stocks based on supply and demand
- **Capital Budgeting** - choosing the right plan or investment.
- **Transportation** - the movement of products.

## Operations
- activities done such activities
    - planning -> strategize and know its objectives.
    - production -> activities to create goods/services.
    - marketing -> promotions of products and services.

- The activities carried out in an organization.

## Research
- The process of observation and testing characterized by the scientific method.
- Situation, problem statement, model construction, validation, experimentation, candidate solutions.

## Operations Research
- It is a **quantitative approach** to decision making based on the **scientific method** of problem solving.

## Quantitative approach
- numerical data
- statistics
- percentages
- a measurable data

## Scientific Method
- it follows a step-by-step procedure.

**Operations Research** is the scientific approach to execute decision making, which consists of:
    - The art of **mathematical modeling** of complex situations.
    - The science of the development of **solution techniques** used to solve these models.
    - The ability to effectively communicate the information to the user.

## Career Opportunities
1. OR professionals aim to provide **rational bases for decision making** by seeking to **understand** and structure complex situations and to use this understanding to **predict** system behavior and **improve** system performance.

2. Much of this work is done using **analytical** and **numerical** techniques manipulate

## Operations Research Model

**Deterministic Modeling vs Stochastic Modeling**

Deterministic | Stochastic
--------------|--------------
assume all data are known with certainty | explicitly represent uncertain data via random variables or stochastic process
optimization | characterize / estimate system performance
certain | uncertain
data are not random | data are random
Example Kelvin = Celcius + 273.15 | Example: Tossing a coin, rolling a dice

## What is Quantitative Analysis

**Quantitative factors** might be different investment alternatives, interest rates, inventory levels, demand, or labor cost.
    - include numerical
    - analyzed using statistical methods

**Qualitative factors** such as the weather, country condition and legislation, and technology breakthroughs should also be considered.
    - opinions
    - more subjective
    - crucial for decision-making

## The QA / MS / OR approach

> Defining the problem -> Developing a Model -> Acquiring Input Data -> Developing a Solution -> Testing the Solution -> Analyzing the result

## Defining the problem
Need to develop a clear and concise statement that gives direction and meaning to the following steps.

- This may be the most important and difficult step.
- It is essential to go beyond symptoms and identify true causes
- May be necessary to concentrate on only a few of the problems - **selecting the right problem is very important**
- Specific and measurable objectives may have to be developed

> Defining the problem \ It is crucial as you must have a useful outcome

## Developing a Model
Quantitative analysis models are realistic, solvable, and understandable mathematical representation of a situation

## Quantitative Analysis Models
represented by numbers or formula

### There are different types of models
1. **Scale Model**
    - represented by physical objects

2. **Schematic Model**
    - represented by diagrams

## Acquiring Input Data
Input data must be accurate - GIGO rule

Data may come from a variety of sources such as company reports, company documents, interviews, on-site direct measurement, or statistical sampling

> GIGO RULE: the output of the process is accurate if the input is also accurate.

## Developing a Solution

The best (optimal) solution to a problem is found by manipulating the model variables until a solution is found that is practical and can be implemented

**Common techniques are:**
- Solving **equations**
- **Trial and error** - trying various approaches and picking the best resul
- Complete enumeration - trying all possible values
- using an **algorithm** - a series of repeating steps to reach a solution


## Testing The Solution

Both input data and the model should be tested for accuracy before analysis and implementation
- New data can be collected to test the model
- Results should be logical, consistent, and represent the data

## Analyzing the Results

**Determine the implications of the solution**

- Implementing results often require change in an organization
- The impact of actions or changes needs to be studied and understood before implementation

> are result of a solution. Asses if the result will solve the problem

**Sensitivity analysis** determines how much the results of the analysis will change if the model or input data changes
    - Sensitive models should be very thoroughly tested

> an approach to test the quality of a model


## Implementing the Results
**Implementation incorporates the solution into the organization**
- Implementation can be very difficult
- People can resist changes
- Many quantitative analysis efforts have failed because a good, workable solution was not properly implemented

**Changes occur over time, so even successful implementation must be monitored to determine if modifications are necessary**
