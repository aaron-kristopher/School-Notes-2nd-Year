> He must ==exhibit self-denial and abandon his personal interests== to ==place those of his country before any other== and whose ==deeds and acts are proudly emulated by grateful people== who, after his death, render him singular tributes, honor him with public worship and ==acknowledge his meritorious service== to mankind by spontaneous national recognition
