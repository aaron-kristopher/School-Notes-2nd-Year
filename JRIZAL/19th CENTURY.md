Modern Philosophy - close at the end of the 18th & 19th century.

- It was replete with _rebellious political_ and _religious outlook_
- This was a deviation from what was deeply rooted, _the theory on divine life_ which is the _basis of absolute monarchy_


##### Divine Right Theory

- It is a theory which lends legitimacy to absolute monarchy
- The state is of divine creation and the ruler is ordained by God to govern the people

**But it was challenged:**

- The proponents are: _John Locke, jean Jacques, _

#### 19TH CENTURY: ERA OF ENLIGHTENMENT

- Age of Enlightenment also the Age of Reason, was an intellectual and Philosophical movement and occurred in Europe in the 17th and 18th Centuries

1. John Locke

	Man is endowed with natural gifts such as right to life, liberty and property and it was in the form of social contract that men formed a civil society to protect these basic human rights.
