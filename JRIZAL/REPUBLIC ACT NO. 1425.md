- Senate Bill 448 met with opposition from the **_Senators Francisco "Soc" Rodrigo, Mariano Jesus Cuenco and Decoroso Rosales._** For them, requiring the teaching of Rizal in Schools would be a violation of religious freedom. 

May 12, 1956 a compromise (from compulsion to inclusion) inserted by Senate Committee Chairman of Education Jose P. Laurel, accommodated the objectives of the Catholic Church. College students would have an option of reading the two novels (but not to exempt them from taking the course).
